# Decisions-DisruptionsAI
My university project.
The project was to use reinforcement learning to model the attacks used in the cyber security board game Decisions & Disruptions https://www.decisions-disruptions.org/.
The project was written in Python.
A very simple Monte Carlo algorithm has been used but this could be improved in the future.
My final report for the project is in the pdf file https://github.com/SamMurray0/Decisions-DisruptionsAI/blob/main/Final%20Report.pdf
